            <h1>Internet Search</h1>
            <p class="text-justify">The second part of "The True Story of the Internet" is about search engines. Search engines play a very important role in our life today because they
            help us find the results we want when searching the web. This part of the series called Internet Search is mainly focused on how the uprising of search engines happened.
            The movie starts off with the narrator talking about how the world was alot different before the invention of the search engine. The movie goes into Silicon Valley and talks about how Yahoo had started:
            </p>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>Silicon Valley is an area of California where many big tech companies are born out of.</li>
            <li>Jerry Yang and David Filo were trying to use the internet to find a way to win a Stanford Fantasy Basketball league. </li>
            <li>David Filo and Jerry Yang were electrical engineering students at Stanford. </li>
            <li>David had figured out a way to search the web efficiently.</li>
            <li>David and Jerry then created a big database of links with categories which allowed you to surf the web quickly altho it was nothing like Yahoo today. </li>
            <li>This was called David and Jerrys’ Guide to the World Wide Web.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="text-center">
            <p>Eventually it had been renamed to Yahoo however they needed funding because it costs money to scale a project like this. It was very hard to find funding because at the time it was hard to make money
                on the internet. However some venture capitalists had believed the internet had huge potential for advertising although David and Jerry didn't believe in advertising. They were one of the people on the other side of the camp that believed the internet was for freedom
                and not advertising. After awhile search engine companies became very hungry and didn't focus on their product as much.
            </p>
            <p>This is when google had emerged. Google was coming out of Stanford aswell. Google:</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>had worked by link counting. The links that were visited the most were at the top of the search.</li>
            <li>Excited(another company) was thinking about buying out google but they decided to decline buying them from $1,000,000.</li>
            <li>Google did not want to put big banner ads on their website so they found another way to monetize.</li>
            <li>They had sold keywords to companies which had allowed companies to change words in their site so their websites showed up at the top on Google.</li>
            <li>This had brought lots of investors into Google and lots of interest. </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="text-center">
        <p>Eventually Google had IPO'd and their stock shares had soared. They were the fastest growing company of all time. This is the Google we use today and we should remember the history of how it got here.</p>
